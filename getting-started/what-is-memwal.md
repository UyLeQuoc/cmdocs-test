title: "What is MemWal?"
description: "Persistent, verifiable memory for AI agents"
---

<Note>
MemWal is currently in beta and actively evolving. While fully usable today, we continue to refine the developer experience and operational guidance. We welcome feedback from early builders as we continue to improve the product.
</Note>

MemWal introduces a long-term, verifiable memory layer on Walrus, allowing agents to remember, share, and reuse information reliably.

## Motivation

AI agents today lose context between sessions — every conversation starts from scratch. When memory does exist, it's locked inside platform-specific databases that the user doesn't control. MemWal solves this by giving agents:

- **Persistent memory** — context that carries across sessions and apps
- **Decentralized, highly available storage** — with end-to-end encryption baked in
- **Provable ownership** — cryptographically enforced, not just a policy promise
- **Fine-grained access control** — users decide who can read, write, or delegate access

## Features

### Memory Operations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Remember" icon="floppy-disk">
    Store memories with semantic understanding. The relayer generates vector embeddings so your data is searchable by meaning, not just keywords.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recall" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Retrieve relevant memories using natural language queries. Finds the closest matches based on meaning, scoped to your memory space.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyze" icon="microscope">
    Extract structured facts from text automatically. Each fact is stored as a separate memory for more precise recall later.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask" icon="comments">
    Query your memories and get an AI-generated answer with the relevant context attached. Combines recall with LLM reasoning.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Security & Access Control

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="End-to-End Encryption" icon="lock">
    All content is encrypted via SEAL before it reaches Walrus. Only the owner and authorized delegates can decrypt it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decentralized Storage" icon="globe">
    Encrypted blobs stored on Walrus — no single point of failure, no central operator holding your data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Onchain Ownership" icon="key">
    Ownership and access enforced by Sui smart contracts. Cryptographic and tamper-proof.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delegate Access" icon="user-group">
    Grant scoped access to other users, agents, or services — all managed onchain by the owner.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Infrastructure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Restore" icon="rotate">
    Rebuild your index from Walrus if it's ever lost. Rediscovers blobs by owner and namespace, re-embeds only missing entries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Middleware" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Drop-in memory for Vercel AI SDK apps. Automatically saves and recalls context around AI conversations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What's Included

- **TypeScript SDK**: integrate memory into any app with a few lines of code
- **Relayer**: handles encryption, storage, and retrieval behind a simple API
- **Smart Contract**: enforces ownership and delegate access onchain
- **Indexer**: keeps onchain state synced for fast lookups
- **Dashboard**: manage accounts, memory, and delegate keys visually

## Use Cases

MemWal fits any app that needs to store, retrieve, and update memory persistently:

- **AI chat apps** — capture valuable knowledge from conversations so agents remember context across sessions
- **Note-taking and knowledge tools** — save user insights, summaries, and references as persistent, encrypted memory
- **Multi-agent workflows** — share a common data layer between agents for task lists, knowledge bases, and coordination state
- **Personal AI assistants** — build agents that learn and adapt over time without losing what they've learned
- **Cross-app memory** — let users carry their memory between different apps and services, owned by them

And many more — check out the example apps below to see MemWal in action.

## Example Apps

The repo ships with ready-to-run apps in the [`/apps`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/MemWal/tree/main/apps) directory:

- **Playground** — dashboard demo for MemWal
- **Chatbot** — AI chat app with persistent memory across sessions
- **Noter** — note-taking tool that stores knowledge as encrypted memory
- **Researcher** — research assistant that builds and recalls a knowledge base

See [Example Apps](/examples/example-apps) for short code examples from each app.
