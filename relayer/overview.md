The relayer is the backend that turns SDK calls into memory operations. Using a delegate key signed by the client, it handles the critical workflows — embedding, encryption, storage, and search — on behalf of the user.

## What It Does

- **Authenticates requests** by verifying Ed25519 signatures against onchain delegate keys, then resolving the owner and account context
- **Generates embeddings** for text using an OpenAI-compatible API (default model: `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimensions)
- **Encrypts and decrypts** data through the SEAL sidecar, bound to the owner's address and the MemWal package ID
- **Uploads and downloads** encrypted blobs to Walrus, with the server wallet covering storage costs
- **Stores and searches vectors** in PostgreSQL (pgvector), scoped by memory space (`owner + namespace`)
- **Orchestrates higher-level flows** like `analyze` (LLM-based fact extraction using `gpt-4o-mini`) and `ask` (memory-augmented Q&A)
- **Restores memory spaces** by querying onchain blobs, decrypting, re-embedding, and re-indexing anything missing from the local database
- **Cleans up expired blobs** reactively — when Walrus returns 404 during recall, the relayer deletes the stale vector entries from the database

## Architecture

The relayer is a Rust service (Axum) that manages a TypeScript sidecar process for SEAL and Walrus operations that require the `@mysten/seal` and `@mysten/walrus` SDKs.

    Axum --> DB

    %% sidecar
    Axum --> Sidecar
    Sidecar --> Seal
    Sidecar --> Walrus  
```

The sidecar is started automatically when the Rust server boots and communicates over HTTP on `localhost:9000` (configurable via `SIDECAR_URL`). If the sidecar fails to start, the relayer exits immediately.

## Key Pool

For the `analyze` endpoint (which stores multiple facts concurrently), the relayer supports a pool of Sui private keys (`SERVER_SUI_PRIVATE_KEYS`). Each concurrent Walrus upload uses a different key from the pool in round-robin order, bypassing per-signer serialization and enabling parallel uploads.

## Single-Instance Design

Each relayer deployment is tied to a single MemWal package ID (`MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID`). The package ID is used for SEAL encryption key derivation and Walrus blob metadata. Queries in the vector database are scoped by `owner + namespace`, while the package ID provides cross-deployment isolation at the encryption layer.

<Note>
The current relayer does not support multi-tenancy across multiple package IDs. If you deploy a separate MemWal contract, you need to run a separate relayer instance with its own database.
</Note>

## Trust Boundary

In the default SDK path, the relayer sees plaintext data because it handles encryption and embedding on your behalf. This is a deliberate trade-off for developer experience — it means Web2 developers don't need to manage cryptographic operations.

If you need to minimize this trust, you can [self-host](/relayer/self-hosting) the relayer or use the [manual client flow](/sdk/usage/memwal-manual) to handle encryption and embedding entirely on the client side. See [Trust & Security Model](/fundamentals/architecture/data-flow-security-model) for the full breakdown.
