title: "Self-Hosting"
---

Self-hosting means running your own relayer — either pointing at an existing MemWal package ID or deploying an entirely new MemWal instance with your own contract, database, and server wallet.

The managed relayer provided by Walrus Foundation is a reference implementation. You can also build your own implementation that fits the same API surface with custom logic. This guide covers how to run the reference implementation as your own self-hosted relayer.

## When to Self-Host

The most common reasons are removing the trust assumption on a third-party relayer or running your own MemWal instance entirely:

- **Control the trust boundary** — a self-hosted relayer keeps plaintext, encryption, and embedding under your own control
- **Run your own MemWal instance** — deploy your own contract with a separate package ID, SEAL encryption keys, and data isolation
- **Choose your own embedding provider** — use your own OpenAI-compatible API and credentials
- **Guarantee availability** — the managed relayer is a beta service with no SLA

## What Runs

A self-hosted MemWal backend has:

| Component | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Rust relayer** | `services/server` | Axum HTTP server — auth, routing, embedding, vector search |
| **TypeScript sidecar** | `services/server/scripts` | SEAL encrypt/decrypt, Walrus upload, blob query (uses `@mysten/seal` and `@mysten/walrus`) |
| **PostgreSQL + pgvector** | External | Vector storage, auth cache, indexer state |
| **Indexer** (recommended) | `services/indexer` | Polls Sui events, syncs account data into PostgreSQL |

The Rust relayer starts the TypeScript sidecar as a child process on boot. They communicate over HTTP (`localhost:9000` by default). If the sidecar fails to start within 15 seconds, the relayer exits.

## Quick Start

If you do not already have PostgreSQL + pgvector running, start it with:

```bash
docker compose -f services/server/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
```

Then run the relayer:

```bash
cp services/server/.env.example services/server/.env
cd services/server/scripts
npm ci
cd ..
cargo run
```

Then check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID`
- `MEMWAL_REGISTRY_ID`
- `SERVER_SUI_PRIVATE_KEY` or `SERVER_SUI_PRIVATE_KEYS`
- `SEAL_KEY_SERVERS` — comma-separated list of SEAL key server object IDs

### Recommended

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — enables real embeddings (falls back to mock embeddings without it)
- `OPENAI_API_BASE` — point to an OpenAI-compatible provider like OpenRouter

### Defaults

- `PORT` defaults to `8000`
- `SIDECAR_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:9000`
- `SUI_NETWORK` defaults to `mainnet`
- `SUI_RPC_URL`, Walrus endpoints, and `WALRUS_PACKAGE_ID` fall back to network defaults based on `SUI_NETWORK`
- The sidecar Walrus upload route defaults storage `epochs` by network: `50` on `testnet`, `2` on `mainnet` (unless the request passes `epochs`)

### Server Keys

- `SERVER_SUI_PRIVATE_KEY` is the main server key
- `SERVER_SUI_PRIVATE_KEYS` is a comma-separated key pool for parallel Walrus uploads
- if both are set, the key pool takes priority for uploads

## Package Contract IDs
### Staging (Testnet)
```env
SUI_NETWORK=testnet
MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID=0xcf6ad755a1cdff7217865c796778fabe5aa399cb0cf2eba986f4b582047229c6
MEMWAL_REGISTRY_ID=0xe80f2feec1c139616a86c9f71210152e2a7ca552b20841f2e192f99f75864437

```
### Production (Mainnet)
```env
SUI_NETWORK=mainnet
MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID=0xcee7a6fd8de52ce645c38332bde23d4a30fd9426bc4681409733dd50958a24c6
MEMWAL_REGISTRY_ID=0x0da982cefa26864ae834a8a0504b904233d49e20fcc17c373c8bed99c75a7edd
```

For SEAL key server object IDs on testnet, see https://seal-docs.wal.app/Pricing.

Using official key server of SDK is recommended. 

<Note>
`VITE_MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID` and `VITE_MEMWAL_REGISTRY_ID` are frontend env vars for the app or playground — not for the relayer.
</Note>

## Database Setup

The relayer requires PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension. The relayer runs migrations automatically on boot, creating these tables:

- `vector_entries` — 1536-dimensional embeddings with HNSW index for cosine similarity search
- `delegate_key_cache` — auth optimization (delegate key → account mapping)
- `accounts` — populated by the indexer (account → owner mapping)
- `indexer_state` — indexer cursor tracking

See [Database Sync](/indexer/database-sync) for the full schema.

## Operational Notes

- The server starts the sidecar automatically on boot — if sidecar startup fails, the relayer will exit
- DB migrations run automatically on boot (`pgvector` must already be installed as a PostgreSQL extension)
- Connection pool: 10 max connections (relayer), 3 max connections (indexer)
- `/health` is the basic service check, API routes live under `/api/*`
- The indexer is recommended for fast account lookup in production — without it, the relayer falls back to onchain registry scans
- Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the server uses deterministic mock embeddings (hash-based) — useful for local testing but not production

## Docker

- `services/server/Dockerfile` for the relayer
- `services/indexer/Dockerfile` for the indexer
