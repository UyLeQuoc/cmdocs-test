Get the plugin running and test the memory loop in a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) `>=2026.3.11` installed and running

You'll also need a **delegate key**, **account ID**, and **relayer URL** from MemWal — the steps below will guide you through getting these.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the plugin

    ```bash
    openclaw plugins install @mysten-incubation/oc-memwal
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Get your MemWal credentials

    The plugin needs three values to connect to MemWal:

    | Value | What it is |
    |-------|-----------|
    | **Delegate Key** | A private key (64-char hex) used to sign requests and encrypt memories |
    | **Account ID** | Your MemWalAccount object ID on Sui (`0x...`) |
    | **Relayer URL** | The MemWal relayer endpoint that handles search, storage, and encryption |

    The easiest way to get your delegate key and account ID is through the [MemWal dashboard](https://memwal.ai). See the [main Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) for detailed setup instructions.

    For the relayer URL, use a managed endpoint or deploy your own:

    | Environment | Relayer URL |
    |-------------|-------------|
    | **Production** (mainnet) | `https://relayer.memwal.ai` |
    | **Development** (testnet) | `https://relayer.dev.memwal.ai` |

    <Info>
    These managed relayer endpoints are provided as a public good by Walrus Foundation.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set your delegate key

    Store your delegate key as an environment variable so it's never hardcoded in config files:

    ```bash
    # Add to your shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)
    export MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY="your-64-char-hex-key"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure OpenClaw

    Add the plugin config to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

    ```jsonc
    {
      "plugins": {
        "slots": { "memory": "oc-memwal" },
        "entries": {
          "oc-memwal": {
            "enabled": true,
            "config": {
              "privateKey": "${MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY}",           // References the env var
              "accountId": "0x3247e3da...",                     // Your account ID from the dashboard
              "serverUrl": "https://relayer.dev.memwal.ai"     // Or your self-hosted relayer
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Accordion title="Optional settings">
      You can add these to the `config` block to tune behavior. The defaults work well for most setups.

      | Option | Default | Description |
      |--------|---------|-------------|
      | `autoRecall` | `true` | Inject relevant memories before each turn |
      | `autoCapture` | `true` | Extract and store facts after each turn |
      | `maxRecallResults` | `5` | Max memories to inject per turn |
      | `minRelevance` | `0.3` | Relevance threshold (0-1) for memory injection |
      | `captureMaxMessages` | `10` | How many recent messages to analyze for facts |
      | `defaultNamespace` | `"default"` | Memory scope for the main agent |
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start OpenClaw

    ```bash
    openclaw gateway stop && openclaw gateway
    ```

    You should see in the logs:

    ```
    oc-memwal: registered (server: https://..., key: e21d...ed9b, namespace: default)
    oc-memwal: connected (status: ok, version: ...)
    ```

    <Tip>
    If you see `health check failed`, check that your relayer URL is reachable and your `MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY` env var is set.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

### Check connectivity

Run the stats command to confirm the plugin is connected:

```bash
openclaw memwal stats
```

This shows the relayer status, your key (masked), account ID, active namespace, and whether auto-recall/capture are enabled.

### Test the memory loop

The core value of the plugin is the automatic recall/capture cycle. Test it end-to-end:

**1. Store a fact** — start a conversation and share something memorable:

```
You: I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for backend work
Bot: (responds normally)
```

Check logs — you should see:
```
oc-memwal: auto-captured 1 facts (agent: main, namespace: default)
```

**2. Recall it** — in a **new conversation**, ask about it:

```
You: What programming languages do I like?
```

Check logs — you should see:
```
oc-memwal: auto-recall injected 1 memories (agent: main, namespace: default)
```

**3. Search from terminal** — confirm the memory exists via CLI:

```bash
openclaw memwal search "programming"
```

If all three steps work, the plugin is fully operational.

### Enable LLM tools (optional)

By default, the plugin works entirely through hooks — the LLM doesn't know about memory tools. To give the LLM explicit control, add tools to your agent profile:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "allow": ["memory_search", "memory_store"]
  }
}
```

Then the LLM can call `memory_search` and `memory_store` on its own when it decides to. This is a power-user feature — hooks handle the common case automatically.
